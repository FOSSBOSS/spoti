You have seen these types of images for getting music from spotify, using the app, or a webcamera.

well, this weekend I thought it might be fun to create a cipher wheel that functions the same way 
as a ceaser cipher wheel does. The spotify encoding has some rules with complex math you can read all about here:

but if youre like me, and I know I am, aint no body got time for that. I want to spin a roulette wheel of possible 
spotify code generation and listen to random music. 


0th=spotify logo.
1st=1
24th=1
12th=7
should generate a "valid" code

assuming you have an octet from 0-7 as is current to the spotify image codex.
I did not maintain that while cobbling this together. 4 hours. unbelivable.

Whats this about optimazaions?
ugh nothing really, I was all set to be done, but realized the original model wouldnt fit in my 3d printer.
well, I moved the slots around to put long ones next to short ones so I could decrease the radius without 
cuasing clipping conflicts.

Go here to generate spotify codes like a plebian:
